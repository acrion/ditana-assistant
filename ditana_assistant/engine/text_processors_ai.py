def generate_factual_query(request: str, messages: List[Dict[Literal["role", "content"], str]]) -> str:
    """
    Generate a factual query as part of the Introspective Contextual Augmentation process.

    This function is a key component of the Introspective Contextual Augmentation feature. It takes a complex request
    and generates a simpler, more focused sub-question aimed at extracting factual, numerical, or definitional
    information. This sub-question is designed to provide additional context for the original request when answered,
    enhancing the systemâ€™s introspective reasoning capabilities.

    The function operates by:
    1. Constructing a prompt that identifies a component of the request that could benefit from precise data.
    2. Ensuring the request is in English.
    3. Passing the constructed prompt to a ConversationManager for processing, simulating an introspective thought process.

    Args:
        request (str): The original complex request or question.
        messages (list): The dialog history so far, used for contextual understanding.

    Returns:
        str: A generated factual query suitable for augmenting the context.

        This function is part of the broader Introspective Contextual Augmentation process and relies on:
        - text_processors_ai for language conversion
        - conversation_manager.ConversationManager for simulating introspective reasoning

    Generate a critical question based on a preliminary assistant answer within the context of a conversation.

    This function is part of the Introspective Contextual Augmentation process. It aims to enhance the quality and
    depth of responses by generating a critical question that challenges or seeks clarification on the preliminary
    answer provided by the assistant.

    The function works by:
    1. Appending the preliminary answer to the conversation history.
    2. Using a ConversationManager to process a prompt requesting a critical question.
    3. Returning only the generated question without any additional comments.

    Args:

    Returns:
        str: A critical question related to the preliminary answer, without any additional commentary.

    Note:
        This function relies on the ConversationManager for processing the request and generating the critical question.

    Example:
        preliminary_answer = "The Earth is approximately 4.54 billion years old."
        critical_question = generate_critical_question(preliminary_answer, conversation_history)

    This function is a key component of the Introspective Contextual Augmentation feature. It takes a complex request
    and generates a simpler, more focused sub-question aimed at systematically addressing the first step of the request.
    This sub-question is designed to provide additional context and a structured approach to answering the original request.

    The function operates by:
    1. Ensuring the request is in English.
    2. Constructing a prompt that identifies a suitable first step to address the request systematically.
    3. Passing the constructed prompt to a ConversationManager for processing, simulating an introspective thought process.
    4. Generating both a complete form of the query for prompting and a standalone question for the dialog history.

    Args:
        request (str): The original complex request or question.
        messages (list): The dialog history so far, used for contextual understanding.

    Returns:
        Tuple[str, str]: A tuple containing:
            1. The complete form of the systematic query suitable for prompting.
            2. The standalone question to be inserted into the dialog history.

    with a focus on potential misinterpretations in the text. Itâ€™s designed to enhance the systemâ€™s
    ability to provide accurate and contextually relevant information.

    The function operates by:
    1. Constructing a prompt that includes both the original request and the text.
